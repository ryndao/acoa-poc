# Agnostic ACA Meeting
## 6 PM EST 1st and 3rd Wednesday of the Month



Hello, my name is _______________________.  I’m a recovering adult child.

Welcome to the Wednesday night, Tenderfoot Trail Beginners Meeting of Agnostic ACA.  This is an open meeting of Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families and everyone is welcome.  In adult children of alcoholics, we meet to share the experiences we had as children growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family.  That experience infected us then, and it continues to affect us today.

The only requirement for ACA membership is the desire to recover from the effects of family dysfunction.

This meeting is for beginners, those who have questions about what it means to work a recovery program and those who want to support beginners.  This is also a secular meeting and is an outreach of the Agnostic ACA community and the Agnostic ACA Virtual Intergroup.  We believe recovery is possible in a secular environment.  You do not have to have religion, a personal god, or a specific higher power to work the principles of a recovery program.  Instead, we focus on solutions - recovery is a process, a journey, and it happens one day at a time.

To open the meeting, please join me in a moment of silence followed by our secular version of the ACA serenity affirmation.  This version begins with, “Today, I seek the serenity…”  It will be shared on the screen and you are welcome to unmute yourself and join in.

Begin - 

*__Today, I seek the serenity to accept the people I cannot change, the courage to change the one I can, and the wisdom to know that one is me.__*

### SAFETY STATEMENTS

Because safety is critically important and virtual environments create their own challenges, the chat function will be disabled until the end of the meeting. You will always be able to message the host and co-hosts in the event an issue arises.  Also, during the sharing portion of the meeting, participants will be unable to unmute themselves until they receive an invitation from the host.  The invitation will appear on your screen when you are called on by the chairperson. Lastly, participants will also be unable to rename themselves during the sharing portion of the meeting.

Our group conscience decided some things are distracting and we ask you to keep your video off if you are doing them.  Among these are:  smoking, drinking alcohol and moving around with your device.  Thank you for understanding that meeting safety is everyone’s responsibility.

One more note on safety, sometimes people disrupt meetings and raise the anxiety level for everyone.  In the event someone interrupts the meeting, the host will mute and turn off everyone’s video; the meeting will pause while the host and co-hosts eliminate the disruption.  Please, be patient with us as the meeting will continue once the disruption is resolved.

ACA has a number of documents that are referred to as foundational.  Among them are the 12-steps, 12-traditions and 12-concepts of service.   These are common documents found in most other 12-step fellowships.  ACA has some documents that are only found in this fellowship.  Among these are the Laundry List, also known as the Problem, and the Solution.  These can be found on many ACA websites and in ACA literature, particularly one we call the Big Red Book. 
Additionally, some Agnostic ACA meetings study secular versions of the 12 Steps. We do not promote or recommend any book, or wording, over those in the Big Red Book.

Is there someone who is willing to read the laundry list for us?  It will be shared on the screen.

*__TECH TEAM WILL SCREEN SHARE THE LAUNDRY LIST__*

_**REMEMBER TO THANK THE PERSON WHO READ**_

At this point, we like to introduce ourselves.  If you are new to ACA, to this meeting, or you are celebrating an ACA milestone, please let us know if you are comfortable doing so. We would love to acknowledge those things and get to know you better. You can also state where we are calling from, if you’d like. I’ll start: “Hi, I’m _________ , calling from __________ .”   

Most Agnostic ACA meetings have what we call a “parking lot” time after meetings where people can ask questions and spend some time getting to know each other.  This beginners meeting is part parking lot, a place where you can ask questions, and part informational, in that we will share with you what meetings can be like and what we mean by the term recovery program.  I’ll spend some time sharing with you and then we’ll open up time for questions and sharing.

There is no one right meeting format.  However, we do recommend you try at least six different meetings before you decide if ACA is for you.  It takes about that long to recognize the benefit and gain an understanding of how ACA could help you.  Recovery isn’t easy.  It’s a journey of self-discovery and those of us who have continued to attend meetings, have seen incredible changes in our lives and have gained freedom from the hurts of the past.  We believe both you, and your life, can change in ACA.

It can be difficult to recognize our own self-defeating attitudes and behaviors.  It can be almost impossible to accept that our adult behaviors were created as defenses we used in childhood to survive the chaos and dysfunction we experienced. We felt no one could understand or help us.  Yet, we find, when we begin to practice the principles of the 12-steps and regularly attend meetings, we start to see how our behavior patterns are not really serving us.  We listen to others who have changed their lives.  We recognize change is possible and we slowly begin to explore how we could change our lives.

Anonymity is an important program principle.  What you hear at this meeting should remain at the meeting.  We do not talk about another person’s story or experience to other people.  Please, respect the anonymity of those who share here today.

Remember, adult children come from family backgrounds where feelings and perceptions were judged as wrong or defective.  In order to honor others and maintain healthy boundaries, we do not interrupt, refer to or comment on what another person has said.  We accept without comment what others say because it is true for them.  We take responsibility for our own lives rather than giving advice to others.

We encourage everyone to share openly about their experiences as time allows.  This is a safe space where everyone can feel their feelings in peace, therefore we do not attempt to comfort others should they become emotional during the meeting.  If someone begins to cry, we allow them to feel their feelings without interruption.  We support others by accepting and listening to them.  In this meeting, you can talk about your adult and childhood experiences without fear of judgment.

In order to keep the focus on ourselves, we share our own experiences and feelings and speak from the “I, me or my” position.

Generally, at this point, meetings move into a topic, discussion and sharing portion of the meeting. The chairperson, sometimes called a moderator, is the person who reads the script, calls on people to share and makes sure that people do not monopolize the meeting.  Meetings often have a timekeeper to remind people when it is time to wrap up their share. When meetings have a timekeeper, it is always polite to acknowledge you’ve heard them when they remind you how much time you have left or when your time is up.
Per group conscience - this meeting is now a self-timing meeting.  We ask that you limit your share to 3 minutes so as many as possible have a chance to speak.  If you are unable to time yourself, I am happy to time for you. If I time for you, you will hear “reminder” when you have one minute remaining and “time” when your time has elapsed. 

Today, I’m going to share some information about my personal recovery journey, why I come to meetings, what value meetings bring to me or anything else that comes up for me.  Then, we will open the meeting up for questions and sharing.

### AFTER YOUR SHARE

We use the raise hand function for sharing.  We encourage you to update your version of Zoom if you have not done so recently.  You will find the raise hand feature in the zoom toolbar at the bottom of your zoom window. If you cannot find it, please message the host for assistance.  Thank you.

Remember, this meeting is a self-timing meeting. Please limit your share to three minutes and feel free to ask me for assistance if you are unable to time yourself.

We share until ten minutes before the hour.  Then, we will move to close the meeting.

The floor is now open for questions or sharing. 


__*REMEMBER TO THANK PEOPLE WHO SHARE OR ASK QUESTIONS*__

### AFTER THE LAST SHARE….

Navigating recovery can be difficult on your own.  ACA has a number of ways available to make this easier.  Sponsorship is one, working with a fellow traveler is another.  If you are interested in finding a sponsor or a fellow traveler relationship, please put your information in the chat area when it opens up.

Providing service is an easy way to contribute and give back to ACA.  If you have attended a meeting, you can chair a meeting.  All that is involved is reading a script as I have done today.  In Agnostic ACA, we support everyone providing service and always welcome people who want to explore service positions.

It is time for our Seventh Tradition, which states that “Every ACA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.” 12-step fellowships do not take money from private organizations, public corporations, entrepreneurs, etc.  Everything we do, everything we provide is funded or provided solely by members of ACA.  A contribution can be financial, it can be your time, it can be supporting those of us who do provide service.  It is always appropriate to donate money to ACA meetings. You can contribute to the best of your ability and if that means you cannot afford to donate financially, you are still welcome to attend the meeting.  No one is ever turned away from a meeting if they do not contribute.
To make a 7th tradition donation, use PayPal to make a donation to our e-mail account, agnostic.aca@gmail.com [you can go to the donate page on our website - ACAagnostica.com] 
Will the host please turn the chat function back on? If there was someone whose share resonated with you, or someone you would like to talk with, feel free to reach out to them in chat.
ANNOUNCEMENTS


Agnostic ACA supports multiple meetings a week; all the meetings use the same virtual meeting information. You are welcome to attend any of these meetings, regardless of how much time you have in recovery. 


The booklist we’ve put together, and our secular versions of the steps are available on our website.


We use a chat platform called Discord to stay in touch in between meetings.  We have built a vibrant, virtual community there and we invite you to join us.


If you have questions, feel free to stay after the meeting for our social Parking Lot time and we will do our best to answer them for you. 

Are there any announcements for the benefit of the group?

Before we close with the ACA Serenity Affirmation and Responsibility Statement, I’m looking for a volunteer who is willing to read the promises for us.  This group uses a slight modified version and it will be shared on the screen.  We ask that you read that version.  Who would like to read them for us?

### AFTER THE PROMISES HAVE BEEN READ…

Thanks to everyone for being here, for listening, and for sharing. I will read the responsibility statement and then invite everyone to read the Serenity Affirmation with me. 

__*THE CHAIRPERSON NOW READS THE RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT BELOW*__

We are responsible.  When anyone, anywhere reaches out for help, I want the hand of ACA to always be there.  And, for that, we are responsible.


Please go ahead and unmute if you would like to join me in reading the ACA serenity statement.
Today, I seek the serenity to accept the people I cannot change, the courage to change the one I can, and the wisdom to know that one is me.
