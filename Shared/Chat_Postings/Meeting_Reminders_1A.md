## MEETING REMINDERS

Group conscience has decided that smoking, drinking alcohol on screen, and carrying us with you as you walk through your house during the meeting can be distracting. We request you turn off your video if you are doing these things. Thank you for your understanding as we work to keep this space as safe as possible.

The chat function and ability to unmute yourself will be disabled during the sharing portion of the meeting. You may always message the host and co-host should an issue arise. These functions will be turned back on at the end of the meeting.
